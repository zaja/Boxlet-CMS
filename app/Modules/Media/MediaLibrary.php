/**
 * The picture library: what there is, what uses it, and what happens when one goes.
 *
 * FINDING WHAT USES A PICTURE is the interesting part. A media id is a plain integer
 * inside page_blocks.content_json, and neither MySQL nor SQLite can be relied on for JSON
 * functions — SQLite's are a compile-time option, and the SQL would differ anyway.
 *
 * So: narrow with LIKE, confirm in PHP. The narrowing is portable and uses the index-free
 * scan once; the confirmation is exact. Both halves are needed, because LIKE '%"image":7%'
 * also matches id 70 — measured, 2 rows on both engines — and deleting a picture because
 * a different picture's id happens to start with the same digits would be unforgivable.
