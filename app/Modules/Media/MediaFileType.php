/**
 * Whether a file may be uploaded at all, and what it may be stored as (SPEC §6).
 *
 * Three things decide, and all three must agree:
 *
 *   what it CLAIMS     the browser's filename extension — never trusted, only used to
 *                      reject early and to pick the stored extension once the sniff agrees
 *   what it IS         finfo reading the bytes, which is the only opinion that counts
 *   what we ALLOW      a closed list of formats, so a new one is a decision rather than
 *                      an accident
 *
 * HEIC is refused deliberately, even where the server could read it. Most shared hosts
 * cannot, and an upload that works for the developer and fails for the customer is worse
 * than one that always says "convert it first".
 *
 * Split from MediaUpload, which reached the 300-line rule when suggested alt text (D-025)
 * added two lines to it. The seam is a real one and not a line count: this answers what
 * may come in, while MediaUpload puts it somewhere and records it. Nothing here touches a
 * database or the filesystem beyond reading the bytes it is asked about.
