/**
 * Admin: the picture library — what is in it, and putting more in.
 *
 * One picture on its own is MediaItemController. This is the list and the upload.
 *
 * UPLOADING IS THE PART THAT FAILS ON A REAL SERVER, and it fails in three different
 * places. Each one has to say something a person can act on:
 *
 *   nginx        refuses a body over client_max_body_size — 1 MB by default — and answers
 *                413 itself, before PHP runs at all. Nothing here can catch that, which
 *                is why media.js checks the size in the browser and says so rather than
 *                letting the submit produce a server error page nobody can read.
 *   PHP          discards a post over post_max_size entirely: $_POST and $_FILES both
 *                arrive empty. The router tells that case from an expired form, because
 *                the missing CSRF token is a symptom and not the cause.
 *   the encoder  runs out of execution time part-way through the variants. That is what
 *                the budget below and the Finish button are for: a picture that did not
 *                finish is listed as unfinished, rather than silently half-made.
