/**
 * ONE SOURCE FOR EVERY VARIABLE Pages/views/layout.php READS (PLAN.md D-057).
 *
 * There are two renderers of the site's layout — a visitor's page, and the admin's design
 * preview — and until now the second answered "what does that layout need?" from a literal
 * array somebody had to remember to update. It was caught out three times: by `description`,
 * then by `icon`, then by the chrome of slice 5c. The comment above it said, correctly, that
 * the real fix is one source for these variables rather than a louder warning. This is it.
 *
 * Two locks, so there is no fourth time:
 *   - the declared return shape below. A factory that DROPS a key fails PHPStan before any
 *     test runs.
 *   - tests/page_layout_test.php reads the template itself and compares what it uses with
 *     KEYS. A variable the template GROWS fails there, by name. That is the half the test
 *     suite could not do on its own: it fails on any notice, but only along the branch some
 *     test happens to render, and `icon` sits behind an `if`.
 *
 * @phpstan-type LayoutData array{
 *     title: string,
 *     description: string,
 *     canonical: string|null,
