   * white flash, a lost scroll position, and the fonts and pictures fetched again — every
   * 250ms while a slider was being dragged.
   *
   * THE LIST NAMES WHAT RELOADS, and anything not named takes the fast path, so this is the
   * one thing here that has to be kept honest as decisions are added. It was MEASURED
   * rather than reasoned: the preview was fetched with each of the 52 controls moved in
   * turn and the HTML compared. Nine changed it — the two bleeds, which menu the header
   * draws, four of the chrome's layout choices, and the footer's small print. `boxed` did
   * NOT, which is the one this would have got wrong by reasoning: an unboxed page is a
   * frame of zero rather than a different sheet, deliberately (Derived::page, D-067).
   *
   * The whole Chrome tab is named even so, although three of its choices measured as
   * token-only: they are choices about a thing built out of markup, and the next one added
   * is more likely to be markup than not. A needless reload is the old behaviour; a missed
   * one is a screen showing something the site will not do.
