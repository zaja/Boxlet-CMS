 *
 * WHAT MOVED HERE. surface, rhythm, width, align, divider and the background picture used
 * to be typed at `blocks[b42][style][…]` and were written onto the section on save, because
 * a block was a section (D-095 undid that in the database; this undoes it in the form). They
 * are now typed at `sections[s7][style][…]`, once per section however many blocks it holds,
 * which is the whole point: a tinted band of three text blocks is one setting.
 *
 * A SECTION'S NAME, like a block's (D-094): `s7` for a section the database knows, `m0` for
 * one made in this session. The two namespaces are deliberately different letters — a block
 * key and a section key are read by the same JavaScript rename engine, and `b7` meaning a
 * block while `s7` means a section is a difference a reader can see at a glance.
