/**
 * Generating the variants of a picture, resumably (SPEC §5.5, PLAN.md D-019's sibling
 * problem: a shared host cuts a request off mid-work).
 *
 * Measured on this machine, a 2400×1600 photograph: one full-size AVIF takes 1272 ms
 * through Imagick, and the whole set of five presets in three formats takes about 5.6 s.
 * A 30-second host survives one upload and not two at once. So generation does what it
 * can inside a budget the caller passes, records what it made, and leaves the row
 * incomplete for someone to finish.
 *
 * The budget is a parameter rather than something read from ini here, because
 * max_execution_time is 0 on this machine: read at the point of use, the whole mechanism
 * would be dead code in development and first exercised on a customer's server.
 *
 * Order is priority order. thumb and card are what the library and most pages show, so
 * they exist first even if nothing else does; full is last because it is the most
 * expensive and the least often needed.

     * One more attempt at an AVIF that came out too heavy, at a lower quality.
     *
     * The 200 KB in SPEC §8 is a budget for a typical photograph, not a contract: over the
     * ten demo photographs at `hero`, nine landed between 18 KB and 83 KB and one — a flat
     * wood-plank texture, which is the worst case for any codec — came out at 234 KB. A
     * site should not ship that silently, so anything over 250 KB is written once more at
     * quality 40 and the smaller file wins.
     *
     * WHERE THIS ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING, measured rather than assumed. GD passes quality
     * to libavif, so the retry works there. ImageMagick 6.9.12-98 — this machine, and CI —
     * IGNORES quality for AVIF and WebP: the same 1920×1080 source came out at 418,673 B
     * at q50, q40 and q10 alike, through setImageCompressionQuality before and after
     * setImageFormat and through setOption('quality') and setOption('heic:quality'). The
     * same build honours it for JPEG (1,397,189 B at q82 down to 268,531 B at q10), which
     * is how we know the value reaches the encoder and the delegate drops it.
     *
     * So on Imagick this costs one extra encode that produces an identical file, which the
     * smaller-wins test below discards. That is the bounded cost of a rule that works on
     * the other driver; it is NOT a measured improvement everywhere, and saying so here
     * would be a comment that explains a thing the code does not do.
     *
     * Giving AVIF real size control on such hosts is PLAN.md O-18, open and deliberately
     * not decided from this one machine.
     *
     * ONCE, never a loop, and only where it applies: AVIF, because it is already the
     * smallest of the three and the one the page serves, and cropped presets, because
     * `full` is the largest public version by design (height 0 = keep the proportions).
     *
     * The retry is written beside the target and moved over it only when it wins. Writing
     * straight over would mean a second pass that came out LARGER had destroyed the better
     * file — and a lower quality setting does not guarantee a smaller file on every codec
     * build. A retry that throws leaves the first result alone: AVIF is best-effort (§5.5)
     * and must never block the set from completing.
     *
