/**
 * ONE SCREEN FOR HOW THE SITE LOOKS (PLAN.md D-059): the character, the ten decisions, the
 * header and footer, and a picture of all of it.
 *
 * It replaces two screens that were one screen cut in half. Header & footer had seven
 * choices and NO PICTURE; Design had a picture that deliberately drew no header or footer.
 * Each was incomplete in exactly the way the other would have fixed, and the owner had to
 * hold the result in their head while moving between them.
 *
 * Saving is still one ordinary form post that works without JavaScript, and applying a
 * character to a site that already has blocks still offers two explicit buttons, because
 * the second overwrites section styles chosen by hand (SPEC §5.4).
