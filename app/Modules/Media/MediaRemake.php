 * Making every picture's sizes again (PLAN.md O-13, D-048): after a preset changes, or to
 * give old pictures what a better encoder makes now — D-047's AVIF quality fix reaches only
 * pictures made after it until this runs.
 *
 * SAFE ON A LIVE SITE. Nothing is deleted first: each variant is written beside its file and
 * moved over it when whole, so a visitor gets the old file or the new one and never half of
 * one, and a picture being remade goes on showing everywhere. Once all of a picture's
 * variants are new its revision goes up, which changes their addresses (MediaPresets::
 * version) and so every browser's cache.
 *
 * RESUMABLE. Work is owed per picture in media.remake — the variants already made again,
 * NULL once done — and each step does what fits in the time it is given, so a pass cut
 * short by the request's time limit carries on where it stopped. The thin wrapper O-13
 * asked for: the encoding is MediaWriter's and the AVIF size rule MediaVariants', exactly
 * as on upload.
