/**
 * Admin: cutting a picture down to the part worth keeping (PLAN.md D-026).
 *
 * Split from MediaItemController, which reached the 300-line rule when this arrived. The
 * seam is a real one and not a line count: cropping already has its own geometry class
 * (MediaCrop), its own script and its own stylesheet, and what remains in MediaItemController
 * is what a picture MEANS and how it ends. This is the one action that makes a new picture
 * out of an old one.
 *
 * THE BROWSER SENDS A RECTANGLE, NEVER AN IMAGE. The dialog shows the `full` variant,
 * because originals are not public (D-020), so the numbers arrive in that variant's pixels
 * and MediaCrop scales them to the original's before anything is cut. Nothing drawn in a
 * browser is trusted as a pixel.
