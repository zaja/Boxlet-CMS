     * One section drawn: the band, its picture, its container, its columns, its blocks.
     *
     * TWO SHAPES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE NEW ONE. A section of one column holding one
     * block is the same element as that block — `<section class="block block-hero …">`,
     * exactly the markup every page has had since the first commit. Anything else draws a
     * column container inside the section and gives each block a div of its own.
     *
     * The second shape is not introduced everywhere for tidiness, and that is the whole
     * argument: the first shape is what every existing page uses, so keeping it means the
     * owner's site cannot move by a pixel, and it can be PROVEN not to have moved —
     * tools/browser-suite/compare.mjs can only compare elements that both captures have,
     * so a wrapper added around every block on every page is exactly the change it cannot
     * check. The cost is two shapes in one method; it is paid once, here, and no
     * stylesheet has to know which one it is looking at, because every block rule is a
     * descendant selector.
     *
     * @param array{layout: string, stack: string, style: array<string, string|int|null>} $section
     * @param list<array<string, mixed>> $blocks each with type, content, layout and column
     *        in the order they are drawn, already filtered to types this install can render
     * @param array<int, Picture> $media
     * THE EDITOR ASKS FOR THE SECOND SHAPE ALWAYS (PLAN.md D-103). A page keeps both, for
     * the reason above; the editor cannot, because a column is the thing a block is dragged
     * into and a band that draws none has nowhere to drop one. One boolean in one function,
     * so the two shapes go on being described in a single place rather than the editor
     * growing a copy of them.
     *
     * NOTHING A STYLESHEET READS CHANGES between the two: every rule that reads `layout-*`
     * is a descendant selector and `block-{type}` selects only chrome (D-093's measurement),
     * so both classes may sit a level lower and no rule stops matching. What differs is a
     * wrapper element, which is why the page — where it can be PROVEN nothing moved — keeps
     * the shape it has always had.
     *
     * @param bool  $eager whether this is the first section drawn on the page
     * @param array<string, mixed> $resolved what the renderer resolved for these templates
