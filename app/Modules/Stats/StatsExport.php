 * Taking the counts out (PLAN.md O-20).

 * Two shapes, for two jobs:
 *   - a CSV of one table as the screen is showing it, for a spreadsheet;
 *   - a JSON file of everything, row for row with the tables, for keeping a copy.
 *
 * One file rather than a ZIP of several, because one file is what a person can look at
 * before trusting it, and because writing a ZIP would be ours to write: the extension for
 * it is optional in PHP.
 *
 * OUT ONLY, at the owner's decision (2026-09-20). There was an import; it is gone. A file
 * of numbers that ADDS to what a site has counted is a way to make statistics say something
 * that never happened, and the counts are worth more when the only thing that can write
 * them is a visit.
