/*
 * What the Appearance screen SHOWS of the server's answer: the inline messages, the derived
 * palette, the contrast gauge, and what every control comes to in words.
 *
 * Split from appearance.js when that passed 300 lines, along the seam it already had: that
 * file ASKS the server and decides what the picture needs; this one only writes down what
 * came back. Nothing here decides anything, which is why none of it needs to know about the
 * preview, the debounce or the reload list.
 *
 * It listens rather than being called, because the two files cannot import each other — the
 * admin has no module loader and by D-013 never will. The same way appearance-stage.js is
 * told what state the screen is in.
 *
 * Optional, like every script here: without it the server's answer simply is not drawn, and
 * Publish re-checks everything anyway.
