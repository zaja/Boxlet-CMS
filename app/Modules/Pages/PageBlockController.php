 * Split out of PageBuilderController, which had reached the 300-line limit. The seam is a
 * real one rather than a convenience: PageBuilderController renders the EDITOR — its shell,
 * its canvas document, and the re-render after a refused save — while this answers the
 * endpoints that draw a FRAGMENT of the page. It writes nothing, ever.
 *
 * Two of them now. `insert()` draws one block, brand new or as it is being edited. `band()`
 * draws a whole section, because some choices are not a block's to show: changing One column
 * to Two rearranges the markup around every block in the band, and no amount of redrawing
 * one of them can put a column there (D-099).
