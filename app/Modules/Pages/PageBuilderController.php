// PageTree supplies the parents a page may have; it excludes the page and its own
// descendants, which is what keeps a cycle out of the hierarchy.

// ones so it shows what a save would store.

/**
 * The visual page editor: a canvas showing the real page, with the block's own fields
 * beside it.
 *
 * The canvas is an iframe rendering the page exactly as a visitor gets it, so site CSS
 * and admin CSS cannot collide and what you see is what the page is. Blocks are not
 * wrapped in editor markup: sections.css styles a section by its position among its
 * siblings, so anything inserted between them would change the page being judged.
 * Selection is a class, and the insertion controls are an overlay.
 *
 * The form is the one from Slice 3, unchanged: every block's fields are real inputs in
 * one form, submitted by an explicit Save to the same endpoint and validated by the same
 * server-side code. The canvas decides which of those groups is on screen.
